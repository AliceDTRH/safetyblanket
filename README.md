This plugin helps people get used to your server by giving them various temporary bonuses, or in other words a safety blanket. This is especially useful for users on other devices or new to the game.

## Features
- Customizable settings<br>
    > All parts of the mod are fully configurable in the configuration file
- Decreased mob spawning<br>
    > Disable *natural* mob spawning around the player.
- Prevent mobs from targeting player<br>
    > Make mobs leave new players alone *(except if they get attacked by the player)*.
- Decreased fall damage<br>
    > Help users get used to fall damage without having to start over.
- Give users regeneration<br>
    > Want to make sure players have time to setup a base? Give them a regeneration boost!

## Commands
- `/disableuserblanket <user>`: Disable a users blanket early. If they still have time left on their blanket, they will get it back when they rejoin.
- `/enableuserblanket <user> <ticks>`: Give user a forced temporary blanket. This is only for testing and will be removed when they rejoin.

## Metrics
This plugin uses bstats Metrics - the same Metrics system used by all Bukkit implementations.<br>
You can find their privacy policy at https://bstats.org/privacy-policy and can disable it in the ```plugins/bStats/config.yml``` file.<br>
I'd really appreciate it if you kept it on though, it helps me figure out if my plugin is being used by anyone and on what types of systems :)<br>
